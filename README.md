INIParser

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is me attempting to learn python by writing a simple parser/converter for .ini -> .json. Pull requests are totally welcome, I'd love to see this become a proper tool rather than just a personal educational project. I intend to write a blog post about this, hence Blogpost.txt recording what it may eventually follow, I will be much more protective about this file than the others as it is my own record of what is going on for a point in time. When I publish the blog, it will be removed as it is not needed.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Nothing special, run Main.py, there are argparse things for the required arguments that should explain what's going on.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* This is me starting with some python, so I haven't written tests yet. Feel free to if you like!
* I'll code review all pull requests, I may ask for clarification on why things have been done; this is mainly for my benefit to understand the language better!
